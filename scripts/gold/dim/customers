   Actions Performed:
		Join tables containing customer information: crm_cust_info (master table), erp_cust_az12, and erp_loc_a101.
        Use gender information on erp_cust_az12 when crm_cust_info contains 'n/a'.
        Add a new column using ROW_NUMBER() that will serve as customer_key.
        Rename columns into meaningful names.
        Sort the columns (left to right) into logical groups to improve readability.
